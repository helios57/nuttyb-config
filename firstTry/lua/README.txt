NuttyB Mod Optimization Gadgets
===============================

This folder contains Lua gadgets required for the "Optimization & Architectural Overhaul" of the NuttyB mod.

Installation Instructions:
1. Copy all `.lua` files from this folder into your mod's `LuaRules/Gadgets/` directory.
2. **IMPORTANT:** You must REMOVE or DISABLE the original Raptor AI gadget (e.g., `gadget_raptor_ai.lua` or similar) to prevent conflicts with the new `gadget_raptor_ai_optimized.lua`. If you keep both, units will receive conflicting orders and behave erratically.
3. Ensure the NuttyB Configurator output (tweaks) is loaded by the game, as these gadgets rely on specific ModOptions (e.g., `fusion_mode`, `adaptive_spawner`).

Files:
- `gadget_raptor_ai_optimized.lua`: Replaces the legacy AI with a performance-optimized version using Time-Slicing and Spatial Partitioning.
- `gadget_fusion_core.lua`: Implements the "Singularity Fusion" mechanics (merging 2x2 structures).
- `gadget_adaptive_spawner.lua`: Implements the "Adaptive Spawner" (compressing Raptor waves).
- `gadget_culling.lua`: Implements the Culling System to maintain SimSpeed.

Configuration:
These gadgets are controlled via ModOptions generated by the NuttyB Configurator website.
